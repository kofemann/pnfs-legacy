   -   under some conditions, an 
         ln -s <ddd> <dir>
       were <dir> is an existing directory doesn't 
       return an error and invalidates some parts inside the
       directory structure. As a result the directory
       can't be removed any more. ( the entries field is
       not zero but there are no entries left. )

req302-2 [SOLVED]  Dec 4
   -   the maximum amount of data in the 1-7 level 
       has to be resticted to some kbytes to make (meta)
       available for users.

   -   dbserver needs to be a real deamon.
   
req302-4
   -   the inheritance of the tags needs to be 
       possible even after the subdirectories are created.

req302-5
   -   we need a better 'mdcreate admin' and all that stuff.

req302-6
   -   a shutdown should be not possible as long as
       dbserver are running.

req302-7  [ SOLVED ]

       <name>.

   -   print the resID for all create operations

req302-10 Dec 9 [ SOLVED ]
   -   inheritance of tags : overwriting inheritance lets content disappear
       or the content is just zero, but the filesize is ok.
         The problem was that setattr changed the attribute of the
         parent. now the chain is broken and the local attributes e
         are set. ( now using md2unchainlow )

req302-10 Dec 11 [ SOLVED ]
   -   still problems with irix and tag inheritance. 
       now the tag inheritance chain is cracked for
       each write.
       !!! append for tags doesn't work ( who cares ?? )

req310-1 Jan 8 1997 [ SOLVED ]
   -   chmod of level 0 doesn't chmod level 1 which was intended
       but caused some problems. 
       So change attribute of level 0 is always propagated to
       level 1 and 6 ( not 2,3,4,5,7 ) 
       This is not true for modifying 1 or 6.
       A touch of 0 will propagate all attributes ( mode mtime atime owner 
       group ) to level 1 and 6. Again not the other way round.
       I don't yet know if it makes sense.

req311-1 Jan 15 1998 [ SOLVED ]
   -   The dbserver stops caused by the semaphore 22 problem is solved now.
       We are now waiting forever for the dbserver to finish.
       But we only wait 3 (tunable) seconds for the dbserver to 
       accept our request.

req311-2 Jav 15 1998
   -   There are 'nfs handles' around with don't match to any
       db id. They caused the dbserver to dump core. This 
       is catched now. But we don't know yet where the
       handles come from. A message is written to pfnsdLog
       whenever this happens.

req311-3 Jav 15 1998 [ goodies ]
   -   sclient is able to 'shutdown' the dbserver.
       sclient can simulate a long dbserver transaction ( for test only )
      
req311-4 Jan 16 1998
   -   The dbserver now flushed the database whenever
       a sclient ... disablewrite is received to make
       consistent backup possible.
         * dbserver/dbserver.c

req311-5 Jan 16 1998
   -   If the dbserver is not able to open the database is read/write
       mode he tries to open it in read/only mode before giving up.
         * dbserver/dbserver.c
         * dbfs/md2lib.c

req311-6 Jan 16 1998
   -   The lookup in fh.c now uses mapDefErrCodes( rc ) ;
       to map the dbfs errorcode to the nfs error codes. [was a bug]
       and the printout now adds the md2 error code to the 
       output line.
         * nfs/fh.c

req311-7 Jan 16 1998

req312-1 Jan 23 1998
   -   Tag behaviour is clearer not. Couldn't find any inconsitencies
       any more. Even the inodes of inherited tags are correct now.

req312-2 Jan 23 1998
   -   Linux produces a logmessage in /var/adm/syslog when
       .(nameof) and .(id) are used together. This is caused by
       using the same inode numbers for all those objects.
       Won't change that in short terms.
         
req312-3 Jan 23 1998
   -   checkDots and checkTags added to briefly check the
       bahavious in new versions. Works fine now on 
       Solaris 2.5.1 , IRIX 6.2 and Linux 2.0.32.

req312-4 Jan 23 1998
   -   New sclient functions 'sclient exec ... listaccess'
       produces a list of dbserver functions and their usages
       together with a timestamp.
 
req312-5 Jan 23 1998
   -   .(get)(cursor) determins the dirID the dirPERM and
       the mountID for martin to find the mountpoint.
req318-1 Oct 20 2001
   -   To remove entries within the dirData record without being
       able to specify the name of the entry :
       scandir.sh returns the position within dirData and
       scandir rmdirentrypos ... is able to use the position to
       remove it.
req318-2 Oct 20 2001
   -   max length of all 'name' inputs (mkdir, touch, ln ... ) is
       restricted to 199  characters by the fh.c module.
       -> sclient can still let the dbserver run into a segv.
req318-3 Oct 20 2001 
   -   md2action 'renameHANDLER' supports the #define MV_ALLOWED and
       MV_DENIED. BUT linux ignores the result of 'rename'.
