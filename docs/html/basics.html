<h1>The Pnfs Basics</h1>
<h3>The pnfsid</h3>
<blockquote>
Each object in the Pnfs Namespace owns a unique ID.
This ID consists of 96 bits. The highest two bytes
specify the database ID and the lowest three bits
specify whether the object is virtual or persistent.
All objects which actually reside in one of the
databases must have the last three bits zero.
The result is that a system can't hold more then 
64K of databases and one database can not have more
then 2 to the power of 77 entries.
PnfsIDs are not reused.
</blockquote>
<h3>How to get the pnfsID</h3>
<blockquote>
The pnfsID of a file or a directory inside pnfs
can by obtained by reading from
<strong>.(id)(&lt;ObjectName&gt;)</strong> were
&lt;ObjectName&gt; is the name of the file or directory.
This syntax only is valid if the object resides in the
current working directory or if specified as last item
of the path string.
<h5>Example</h5>
<blockquote>
<pre>
cd /pnfs/fs/usr/patrick
touch waste
cat .(id)(waste)

or

cd /tmp
touch /pnfs/fs/usr/patrick/waste
cat /pnfs/fs/usr/patrick/.(id)(waste)
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3>How to get the path from the pnfsID</h3>
<blockquote>
Generally it's not possible to get the full path
of a given pnfsID because the full path depends on the
mountpoint, and the mountpoint is not known by the
nfs server. But there is a way to obtain the 
path of the pfnsID seen from the database itself.
The path has to be requested step by step.
First you need to get the objectname itself.
The name is the result of reading from 
<strong>.(nameof)(&lt;pnfsID&gt;)</strong>.
Now you need the pnfsID of the parent directory.
This ID is only defined because pnfs doesn't allow
hard links. To get the parent pnfsID read from
<strong>.(parent)(&lt;pnfsID&gt;)</strong>.
Now you can get the name of the parent directory by
using (nameof) of the parentDirectoryID, and so forth.
There is a tools called <strong>pathfinder</strong>
which follows exactly this procedure. The printout is
shown in the example below. First it iterates down to the
database root and then it assembles the full path.
This path of course doesn't exist on a host, it is the
way the database sees the world. To map it to the
local mounted condition, you need to know the
pnfsID where the mount starts. See the next section
for that.
<h5>Example</h5>
<blockquote>
<pre>
# cd /pnfs/fs/usr/usr/patrick
# touch waste
# pathfinder waste      
000100000000000000015700 waste
000100000000000000015220 patrick
000100000000000000001060 usr
000000000000000000001080 usr
000000000000000000001040 fs
000000000000000000001020 root
000000000000000000001000 -
000000000000000000000100 -
000000000000000000000000 -
/root/fs/usr/usr/patrick/waste
#
</pre>

<h3>How to get the current position ( version >= 3.1.2 )</h3>
<blockquote>
The current position inside pnfs is defined
by the pnfsID and pnfs Permission of the
current directory and the pnfsID for the
mount. Those three values can be read
from 
<stong>.(get)(cursor)</strong>.
See the example for the format.
If you compare the <strong>mountID</strong>
with the list from <strong>pathfinder</strong>
you will find the point where the path of pnfs
ends and the local path starts. 
<h5>Example</h5>
<blockquote>
<pre>
# pwd
/pnfs/fs/usr/usr/patrick
# cat .(get)(cursor)
dirID=000100000000000000015220
dirPerm=0000001400000000
mountID=000000000000000000001040
# 

</pre>

<h3>How to set the size of a file ( version >= 3.1.2 )</h3>
<blockquote>
The size of a fileentry which will only be used as a reference to
a tapefile can be set by the .(fset) command.
The file has to exist and must have zero bytes.
Let's say the filename is &lt;filename&gt; then the creation
of <strong>.(fset)(&lt;filename&gt;)(size)(&lt;size&gt;)</strong>
will set the size of &lt;filename&gt; to &lt;size&gt; bytes.
In a shell script touch will do and in an application 
you need to open the file with O_CREAT.
Trying to change the size with a second open or create will
be silently ignored. To change the filesize the pseodofile
<strong>.(fset)(&lt;filename&gt;)(size)</strong> has to be removed
first.
<h5>Example</h5>
<blockquote>
<pre>
# pwd
/pnfs/fs/usr/usr/patrick
# touch waste
# touch .(fset)(waste)(size)(123456) 
# ls -l waste
-rw-r--r--    1 root     sys       123456 Jan 22 18:28 waste
# touch .(fset)(waste)(size)(123)   
# ls -l waste                   
-rw-r--r--    1 root     sys       123456 Jan 22 18:28 waste
# rm .(fset)(waste)(size)
# ls -l waste           
-rw-r--r--    1 root     sys            0 Jan 22 18:28 waste
# touch .(fset)(waste)(size)(123)
# ls -l waste                   
-rw-r--r--    1 root     sys          123 Jan 22 18:28 waste

<h3>How to create links between databases</h3>
<blockquote>
When mounting the pnfs filesystem the first time, there is
only one entry into the system (/pnfs/fs) which resides on the
<strong>admin</strong> database. To make use of other
databases there must be link created from the admin to the 
new one. This link can be produced, using the standard unix
<strong>mkdir</strong> command.
<pre>
<strong>Syntax : mkdir .(&lt;databaseId&gt;)(&lt;directoryName&gt;) </strong>
</pre>
<br><strong>REMARK : </strong> Eventually this mkdir command returns
some error like <em>Directory already exists</em>. Nevertheless, the
directory has been created sucessfully on the correct database.<br>
The subdirectory &lt;directoryName&gt; will  now point to the
database with the ID &lt;databaseId&gt;.
Use <strong>mdb show</strong> to determine the databaseIDs.
<br>Although it is possible to create these links from each database to
each other database and to create an arbitrary amount of links to 
each database it is wise to setup the links in a very simple manner,
mainly one link from the admin database ( /pnfs/fs/usr ) to each
group database.
<h5>Example</h5>
Create a subdirectory for group <strong>hermes</strong> and create a new database
for this group.
<blockquote>
<pre>
root@watphrakeo:/ > <strong>. /usr/etc/pnfsSetup</strong>
root@watphrakeo:/ > <strong>PATH=$PATH:$pnfs/tools</strong>
root@watphrakeo:/ > <strong>mdb create hermes /needSpaceForHermes/hermesDbFile</strong>
root@watphrakeo:/ > <strong>mdb update</strong>
 Starting hermes
root@watphrakeo:/ > <strong>mdb show</strong>
   ID   Name         Type    Status       Path
 ----------------------------------------------
   0    admin         r     enabled (r)   /uss/db/info.x/admin
   1    user1         r     enabled (r)   /uss/db/info.x/user-db-1
   2    hermes        r     enabled (r)   /uss/db/info.x/hermesDbFile

#
#  The ID of the hermes database seems to be <strong>2</strong>.
#
root@watphrakeo:/ > <strong>cd /pnfs/fs/usr</strong>
root@watphrakeo:/ > <strong>mkdir .(2)(hermes)</strong>
#
#  check if everything went o.k.
#
root@watphrakeo:/ > <strong>cd hermes</strong>
root@watphrakeo:/ > <strong>touch waste</strong>
root@watphrakeo:/ > <strong>cat .(id)(waste)</strong>
000200000000000000001060
root@watphrakeo:/ >
</pre>
<strong>0002</strong>00000000000000001060 indicates that the new directory 
resides on database <strong>2</strong>.
