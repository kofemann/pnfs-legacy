<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<blockquote>
Version 3.1.3 is fully backward compatible. This means 
that the 3.1.3 servers can run against databases
created with previous server versions. <strong>BUT</strong>
after using the hard link feature within 3.1.3 previous 
software versions can no longer be used.

<h3>Hard Links</h3>
<blockquote>
Starting with version 3.1.3 Pnfs supports hard links.
The external trigger which currently simply creates
a file in the <strong>Trash Directory</strong> is fired
after the last link has been removed.<br>
<strong>The pathfinder</strong> command gets totally confused
if the original filename was unlinked.
<br>
By default, the hard link capability is enabled. 
Setting the <strong>/usr/etc/pnfsSetup</strong>
variable <strong>hardlinks</strong> to <strong>off</strong>
disallows the creation of hardlinks. The hardlink unlink
rules are not affected by this variable.

<h3>Improved shutdown behaviour</h3>
<blockquote>
The <strong>pnfs.server stop</strong> procedure no longer
produces inconsistent entries in the filesystem if
performed on a highly busy system.
<p>
Remark :
<blockquote>
An nfs filesystem request is received by one of the 
pnfsDeamons and devided into several database operations.
Those operations are then send to the corresponding
database server via the shared memory link. 
In cases where the shutdown doesn't allow all of those 
subrequests to be finished, there is a high chance of 
inconsistent filesystem entries. With 3.1.3 this can't 
happen any longer as long as the following shutdown
sequence is used :
<ul>
<li>Send SIGTERM to all pnfsd's.
<li>Wait until they are all finished.
<li>Send SIGTERM to all dbservers.
</ul>
This is what <strong>pnfs.server stop</strong> does.
</blockquote> 
<strong>Consequently</strong> it is not longer recommended
to modify the running state of the database servers by
the <strong>mdb update</strong> command without stopping
the pnfs deamons first.

<h3>Access Counter</h3>
<blockquote>
Some methods to obtain statistical informations have been
added.<br><br>
  <strong>.(get)(database)(&lt;dbNumber&gt;)</strong><br>
  <blockquote>
  Reading from <em>.(get)(database)(&lt;dbNumber&gt;)</em>
  returns a one line description of the database &lt;dbNumber&gt;.
  If database &lt;dbNumber&gt; doesn't exist, the 'file not found'
  error is returned.
  </blockquote>
  <strong>.(get)(counters)(&lt;dbNumber&gt;)</strong><br>
  <blockquote>
  Reading from <em>.(get)(counters)(&lt;dbNumber&gt;)</em>
  returns the access counts of database &lt;dbNumber&gt;.
  If database &lt;dbNumber&gt; doesn't exist, the command blocks.
  It would be wise to check the existence with the 
  <em>.(get)(database)(&lt;dbNumber&gt;)</em> call first.
  </blockquote>
  <strong>.(get)(position)</strong><br>
  <blockquote>
  <strong>.(get)(position)</strong> returns the description of
  the current directory position seen from <strong>pnfs</strong>.
  The position is identified by the ID and the permission of the
  current directory and the ID of the mountpoint.
  The information is needed by the DESY <strong>osmcp</strong> to find
  the mountpoint of the current path without OS specific system
  calles.
  <pre>
    dirID=000000000000000000001788
    dirPerm=0000001400000020
    mountID=000000000000000000001040
  </pre>

<h3>File remove action handler modified</h3>
<blockquote>
The file remove action handler performs the following
actions if the link count of a file becomes zero.<p>
For each file level with a content greater then zero,
this content is copied to a file called :
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$trash/&lt;levelNumber&gt;/.&lt;pnfsID&gt;</strong>
if the corresponding directory path exists.<br>
<li>
After the copy operation the file is renamed to
<strong>$trash/&lt;levelNumber&gt;/&lt;pnfsID&gt;</strong>.
</ul>
where $trash is the <em>/usr/etc/pnfsSetup</em> 
<strong>trash</strong> variable.<br>
This behaviour makes the creation of the trashFile 
more or less atomic. The consequence is that
<strong>
files starting with a dot must be ignored in the
trash directories</strong>.
</blockquote>
<li><a href=#export>Export methods improved</a>
<hr>

<h3>Export methods improved</h3>
<blockquote>
The export facility now supports multiple indirections,
mountgroups and exporting filesystems to whole subnets.
<p>
<a href=export.html>The Export Facility</a>
<p>
The previous scheme is part of the new model so there is
no need to change the configuration.
</blockquote>
<hr>
<a name=error222></a>
<h3>The 222 Error</h3>
<blockquote>
The following error message may show up in the dbserverLog file
if the system is heavily loaded.
<pre>
 ... - Request &lt;ReqNum&gt; removed caused by late arrival
</pre>
At the same time a 
<pre>
 ...   (-335) -&gt; -222
</pre>
will appear in the pnfsdLog.
This printout simply indicates that an nfs request arrived which is older
than the request previously processed. <p>
We have to throw away those
requests because on heavy load, the nfs client tends to retry nfs requests.
Both requests may be queued in different pnfs deamons and we can't 
determine the sequence in which they will be processed. Under some very
unlucky conditions we may reply to both requests with a significant 
time interval inbetween. Because other requests concerning the
same filesystem object may have been processed in the meantime
the result can be very destructive.<p>
<strong>So the error message above can be ignored.</strong>

<h3>BUG fix : wrong Object Group ID</h3>
<blockquote>
With version 3.1.3 the Group id of a newly created
file or directory is set to the effective group id
of the user, taken from the unix credentials, 
if the group ID was not set in the attributes.
Before doing so, we observed strange behaviours with Linux and HP-UX. 
</blockquote>

<h3>known BUG : Unix Credential Group ID list ignored</h3>
<blockquote>
Currently we ignore the users group list which is sent
as part of the unix credentials. This may cause 
wrong behavious in conjunction with the chgrp or chown 
command. 
</blockquote>

<h3>Attributes of non top file levels</h3>
<blockquote>
Currently all 8 file levels are created with the same attibutes
like owner, group and permissions. Changing the attributes
of the top layer will always change the corresponding attributes
of layer ONE as well, while the other layers are not affected.
Layer TWO to SEVEN can be changed by the special 
<strong>.(use)(&lt;levelNumber&gt;)(&lt;filename&gt;)</strong>.
