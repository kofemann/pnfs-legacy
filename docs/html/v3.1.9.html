<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<blockquote>
No problem coming from 3.1.3 or later. For earlier versions consult
<a href=v3.1.3.html#comp>V3.1.3</a>.
<br>
<strong>BUT</strong> all binaries must be 3.1.9.

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<blockquote>
<strong>File name length</strong>
<blockquote>
File names and link names may now have up to 199 characters without the 
special pnfs characters ".(...". This is not true for
directory names. Directory names are limited to 199 characters,
pnfs specials included.
</blockquote>
<strong>Removing level files</strong>
<blockquote>
When removing special pnfs level files, the file itself wasn't changed
but the contents of the different levels were written into the
trash directories as if the master (level 0) had been removed.
This caused the backend HSM to remove the file from tape without 
changing the pnfs filesystem entry. (very nasty problem).
<br>Has been fixed.

<h3>Behaviour on high load</h3>
<blockquote>
There are two new compile time flags defining the behaviour of
the pnfs deamons if the number of requests exceeds the maximum
performance of the database servers.
<p>
<strong>POST_TIMEOUT=&lt;#ofSeconds&gt;</strong>
<blockquote>
This options defines the number of seconds the pnfs server
will wait for the database server to become available.
</blockquote>
<strong>NO_ANSWER_ON_TIMEOUT</strong>
<blockquote>
This option defines the type of answer, the pnfs deamon replies
to the client in case the database server doesn't become 
available within POST_TIMEOUT.
If NO_ANSWER_ON_TIMEOUT is defined, the pnfs server won't answer
at all, otherwise it sends an <em>NO SUCH FILE OR DIRECTORY</em>.
</blockquote>
In case the pnfs server is hard mounted, the POST_TIMEOUT should
be set to the nfs client retry time and NO_ANSWER_ON_TIMEOUT
should be defined.

<h3>Modifications for dCache compatibility</h3>
<blockquote>
Some pnfs special commands modify file attributes like filesize or
uid/gid by pnfsId after the object has been created. Unfortunately
the solaris nfs clients send a nfs command setting the group id
after doing the required operation to the id of the sender of the
command, which in terms of the dCache is wrong because the cache
always is running as root. The oberved effect was that after
successfully creating a file with the correct uid/gid of the
user, the file suddenly changed to the gid to 1 or 0 as soon as the
dCache has set the correct filesize. Something similiar happens if
the dCache has to create the file entry. It will do so as root and
later on uses a special pnfs command to change the uid/gid. 
While the uid always changed sucessfully the gid never actually
changed if the dCache PnfsManager has been running on solaris machines.
<br>Has been fixed.

<h3>Security preparation</h3>
<blockquote>
<strong>Disabling remote  <em>remove</em> and <em>move</em> operations</strong>
<blockquote>
Pnfs now allows to block the <em>remove</em> resp. the <em>move</em> operation
on directory bases. For directories mark as <em>non remove/move</em>
these operations are switched off. This feature is intended to soften
the non existing nfs2/3 security mechanisms. All other nfs operations
(e.g. create, chmod, setattr) are not affected.
See <a href="moresecurity.html">Enhanced security</a>
for more information.
</blockquote>
<strong>Preparing dCache strong security access</strong>
<blockquote>
In order to allow a smooth migration from the current nfs2/3 based
security mechanism to a more enhanced one (krb5 or ssl)
v3.1.9 now provides the possiblity to declare directories
as <em>protected</em>. Protected directories can only be modified
by trusted hosts with a trust level of at least 14.
(/pnfs/fs/admin/etc/exports/trusted/...).
It is assumed that all pnfs operations on these directories are done
through secure channels an not via the nfs protocol.
See <a href="moresecurity.html">Enhanced security</a>
for more information.
