<h3>Setsize throu .(pset)(...)</h3>
<blockquote>
V3.1.4 is in the process of being prepared to fit the needs for
the DESY HSM disk cache.<br>
The
<pre>
   create .(pset)(&lt;pnfsId&gt;)(size)(&lt;size&gt;)
   rm  .(pset)(&lt;pnfsId&gt;)(size)(&lt;size&gt;)
</pre>
allows to set the size of a file only knowing its <strong>pnfsID</strong>.
Simalar to .(fset) setting the size to a none zero value is only
allowed once. To reset the size to zero rm .(pset)(...) has to be used.
The .(pset) file doesn't exist as long as the filesize is zero.

<h3>Improved shared memory resource handling</h3>
<blockquote>
V3.1.4 behaves somehow smarter concerning the shmat routines.
Some smaller hosts have a rather low limit of shared memory
attached to one process. If shmcom/shmcomlow.c detects
that limit by not getting a new shared memory area attached,
it detaches those shared memory portions which are no longer needed.
The disadvantage is that this sheme hides the problem of a
badly configured system.

<h3>Extended log for dbserver on remove file</h3>
<blockquote>
The removal of a file is now recorded into <em>$dbserverLog</em> as well as in
<em>$pnfsdLog</em>. The  <em>$dbserverLog</em> prints detailed information
about the attempt to copy the different levels into the <em>$trash</em> directory.
For each level above 0, a return code character is printed inside 
brackets : &lt;xxxxxxx&gt;. Where the position of the 'x' corresponds to
the level from 1 to 7 and the meaning of the characters are :
<table border=0>
<tr><th>Code</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><th>+</th><td>The corresponding level was not empty and could be
                  copied to <em>$trash/&lt;level&gt;/&lt;pnfsID&gt;</em></td></tr>
<tr><th>P</th><td>The level file couldn't be opened.</td></tr>
<tr><th>S</th><td>The level file was empty.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Q</th><td>The trash file of that level couldn't be opened.</td></tr>
<tr><th>R</th><td>An I/O error occured while reading the level file.</td></tr>
<tr><th>W</th><td>An I/O error occured while writing the trash file.</td></tr>
<tr><th>C</th><td>An I/O error occured while closing the trash file.</td></tr>
<tr><th>X</th><td>An I/O error occured while renaming the trash file.</td></tr>

<h3>Known and fixed Bugs</h3>
<blockquote>
The shmcom/shmcomlow.c assumed a NULL as return code from
shmat in cases of problems. BUT shmat returns a (void *) -1.
This has been changed.
