<h1>I/O versus no I/O</h1>
Because Pnfs was designed to distribute a namespace,
regular I/O operations had to be disabled in some way.
The only meaningful NFS2 returncode which could indicate
this behaviour is NFS_IO_ERROR. This nfs error code is
returned whenever a read or write access is performed on
a fileentry which is not enabled for I/O. On the other hand
it would be nice to have the possibility to have
regular files in the filesystem for steering and informational
purposes.<em>( Config files behind a <a href=worms.html>wormhole</a>
or README files in some user directories.)</em>
There are two ways to manipulate the I/O behaviour of 
a file.
<h4>I/O behaviour by 'export' options</h4>
<blockquote>
The third item in the pnfs exports files
in /pnfs/fs/admin/etc/exports/&lt;hostIP&gt; is an integer
decribing the I/O behaviour of the particular mountpoint.
The <strong>30</strong> is the standard option for
hosts which should mainly see the I/O disabled filesystem.
The <strong>0</strong> is the standard option for 
hosts which have to do administrative tasks.
The former disallows I/O at all, which is not very
usefull when reading from configurationfiles
behind a wormhole. To bypass this restriction
a special attribute can be assigned per file.
</blockquote>
<h4>I/O behaviour by 'I/O enabled' flags</h4>
<blockquote>
A file can be I/O enabled individually. This attribute
doesn't change its behaviour when the filesystem is mounted
with <strong>0</strong> but when mounted with <strong>30</strong>
the file behaves like a regular file.
All files in directories which are expected to be behind
wormholes have to be set I/O enabled individually. Otherwise
a <strong>30-exported</strong> filesystem is not able
to read from this file. The attribute <strong>I/O enabled</strong>
disappears of course together with the file after its removal.
<h4>How to set the I/O enable bit</strong>
<blockquote>
<pre>
touch .(fset)(&lt;filename&gt;)(io)
</pre>
sets the I/O enable flag for the file &lt;filename&gt;. The file
has to exist before. The attribute stays with the file
as long as the file is not removed or the attribute is resetted.
<pre>
rm .(fset)(&lt;filename&gt;)(io)
</pre>
removes the I/O enabled attribute again.
<strong>The removal of the 'I/O enabled' flag is not yet implemented
in Pnfs 3.1.2.</strong>
