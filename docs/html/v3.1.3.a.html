<h3>Level Attribute behaviour now tunable</h3>
<blockquote>
With patch level 3.1.3A pnfs allows to specify the behaviour
of level 1 to 7  on the creation of a file and on the
modification of its attributes. Usually the levels behave 
as needed at DESY, which means, level 1, 2 and 7 are
in sync with the top level and the residual levels 
remain unchanged on chmod or chown ... commands.
<br>
With Patch 3.1.3.A a new /usr/etc/pnfsSetup variable
has been added which defines which level keeps in sync
with the top level and which levels remain unchanged.
<pre>
Syntax :     levelmask=0:x:x:x:x:x:x:x
             
             x :  -1   in sync with top level
                   0   uid=0;gid=0;mode=700
