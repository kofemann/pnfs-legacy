<h1>XChanging Pnfs Databases</h1>
It might become necessary to move a complete pnfs system to
a different host or just to exchange databases among
different pnfs systems. Various restrictions apply to these
two actions.
<hr>
<h1>Moving the complete system</h1>
<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<blockquote>

The same gdbm library must be running on both
hosts. This mainly means that the OS must be
complatible and the endianess must be identical.

</blockquote>
<h3>How to ...</h3>
<blockquote>
As long as the directory structure is identical the following 
directories/files have to be moved or created :
<ul>
<li>File /usr/etc/pnfsSetup has to be moved.
<li>Directory $database has to be moved.
<li>All gdbm databases have to be moved. The 'mdb show' command
    gives a list of all database locations.
<li>And of course the binaries and tools in $pnfs/tools.
<li>The $trash directory must be created, with the
    corresponding substructures $trash/1 ... $trash/7.
<li>Last but not least : the log directories have to be 
    created and the logfiles should be touched :
    $pmountdLog, $pnfsdLog, $dbserverLog.
</ul>
If parts of the directory structure differs from the source
machine some adjustments need to be made.
<br>
Files or directories which are listed in /usr/etc/pnfsSetup
only have to be modified within this file if there new 
location differs from the old ones.
<br>
If a database file gets a new location the corresponding
link $database/D-xxxx has to be modified.
After all D* files contain the correct destination the
$database/databases files has to be removed and
'mdb enable admin' needs to be called to recreate the
$database/databases file  again.

<h1>Moving single databases</h1>
Exchanging databases between different pnfs systems has never been
forseen, so there are no 'ready to use' tools available for
such an event. But under certain circustances an exchange is 
possible.
<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
The same gdb library must be running on both
hosts. This mainly means that the OS must be
complatible and the endianess must be identical.
<li>
<strong>There is no way to change the <em>dabaseId</em>
of an existing database.</strong> Consequently the destination pnfs system
must not yet use the database Id of the database which will be
moved.
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>How to ...</h3>
<blockquote>
<strong>What is needed from the source pnfs system ?</strong>
<blockquote>
    You need the <strong>pnfsId</strong> of the top directory within the
    database which will be moved. <br>
    Theoretically it's possible that
    there is more than one topdirectory. This depends on how
    offen the command 
    <strong>mkdir .(&lt;databaseId&gt;)(&lt;dirName&gt;)</strong>
    has been used in conjunction with the concerning database.
    If there is more than one, the procedure has to be repeated for
    each of them.
    <ul>
    <li>'cd' into the directory were the 'mkdir' command has
        been issued.
    <li>use <strong>cat .(id)(&lt;dirName&gt;)</strong> to obtain
        the <strong>pnfsId</strong> of the linkdirectory.
        &lt;dirName&gt; is the name which was used in the mkdir 
        command.
        This resulting pnfsId will be used to relink the directory within
        the new system.<br>
        The first 4 digits of the <em>pnfsId</em> must be
        the hex representation of the concerning databaseId.
    </ul>
</blockquote>
<strong>Copy the databasefile to the new machine/location and
        make it known to the destination pnfs system</strong><p>
<ul>
<li>
The destination pnfs system must be active for the following steps :
<li>
Get the internal dbid of the moved database : 
     <strong>md2tool &lt;databaseFileName&gt; getdbid</strong>
<li>
use <strong>mdb show</strong> to make sure this database id
    is not yet in use.
<li>
use <strong>mdb add &lt;dbName&gt; &lt;fullDatabaseFilePath&gt;</strong>
    to add the file to the destination system. &lt;dbName&gt; as well must be
    unique and not yet in use by the dest. system, but need not be 
    the same as on the source system.
<li>'cd' into the directory from where you want to link to 
    the top directory (directories) of the moved databases.
<li>do a : basename `pwd`  -> <strong>&lt;dirName&gt;</strong>
<li>do a : cd ..
<li>do a : cat .(id)(&lt;dirName&gt;)  -> &lt;dirPnfsId&gt;
<li>the first 4 digits of this &lt;dirPnfsId&gt; are the
    databaseId of the database where we have to create the link.
<li>use 'mdb show' to determine the full path of this database.
<li>deactivate the destination pnfs system : pnfs.server stop
<li>run  'mdb &lt;fullDbPath&gt;' with the following input line :
    <pre>
    addtodirectory &lt;dirPnfsId&gt; &lt;dirName&gt; &lt;linkPnfsId&gt;
    </pre>
    where :
    <ul>
    <li>&lt;dirPnfsId&gt; is the pnfsId of the directory where you want
        to have the link to the new database.
    <li>&lt;dirName&gt; name of this link.
    <li>&lt;linkPnfsId&gt; is the pnfsId of the topdirectory
        to which we want to link.
    </ul>
<li>activate the system again (pnfs.server start)
<li>run 'mdb update'
</ul>
