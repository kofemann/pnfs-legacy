<h1>Getting started</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Unpacking and compiling</h3>
Untar the distribution package. A subdirectory 
like <strong>pnfs3.1.&lt;n&gt;</strong> will be created.
<pre>
cd pnfs3.1.&lt;n&gt;
make clean
</pre>
The 'make clean' command dermines the OS type and version
and creates a soft link of ./version to the corresponding
./version.&lt;os-type&gt; file.
Now you may customize the ./version file to your needs.
It mainly needs information about the compiler, the lex
and where to find the gdbm library. If there is no 
gdbm on our host installed yet, ./gdb/gdbm-1.7.3 contains
the gdbm source distribution which has to be compiled prior to
running make to create the pnfs part.
To create the binaries run :
<pre>
make
make install
</pre>
The exeutables will end up in <strong>tools/&lt;os-type&gt;</strong>.
<br>
<h3>Creating the pnfs file system</h3>
Step by step :
<ul>
<li>You need to setup the <a href=#setup>/usr/etc/pnfsSetup</a> file.
    (see below).
<li>add the pnfs tools to your path.
    Something like :
    <pre>
    . /usr/etc/pnfsSetup
    PATH=$PATH:$pnfs/tools
    </pre>
<li>Try to find some space on the local disk to hold the
    first database. Each file or directory entry will occupy about a KBytes.
<li>Create the first ( admin ) database. 
    Each database has a name, an ID and the actual gdbm database file.
    The name of the first database has to be <strong>admin</strong>.
    <pre>
    mdb create admin /needSpace/admin
    </pre>
    All subsequent databases may have any name ( except 
    some pnfs <a href=v3.1.4.html#note>keywords</a> ) and can be created
    in different directories.
    <br>
    e.g. :
    <pre>
    mdb create user1 /moreSpace/user-db-1
    </pre>
    I would recommend not to store user data on the admin database.
    So at least one additional database is required.
    <br>
    At DESY, we are currently running 38 databases of up to 150MB size without
    observing any performance penalties. Each pnfsd can access each database
    without interfering with other communications. So, using 
    multiple database will share the load among the 
    db processes.
    <p>
    The process of creating a link from the admin database to 
    a different one is described in <a href="basics.html#dblinks">The Basics</a>.
<li>Start the pnfs processes.
    <pre>
    root@watphrakeo:/home/patrick > <strong>pnfs.server start</strong>
    Shmcom : Installed 8 Clients and 8 Servers
    Starting database server for admin (/uss/db/info.x/admin) ... O.K.
    Starting database server for user1 (/uss/db/info.x/user-db-1) ... O.K.
     Waiting for dbservers to register ... Ready
    Starting Mountd : pmountd
    Starting nfsd : pnfsd    
    </pre>
<li>Check if the processes has been created.
    <pre>
    root@watphrakeo:/home/patrick > <strong>mdb show</strong>
      ID   Name         Type    Status       Path
    ----------------------------------------------
      0    admin         r     enabled (r)   /uss/db/info.x/admin
      1    user1         r     enabled (r)   /uss/db/info.x/user-db-1
    </pre>
    The <em>(r)</em> states that the corresponding database server is
    running.
    To create new databases use the 'mdb create ...' command 
    and simply run <strong>mdb update</strong> to start the
    corresponding database server. There is no need to restart the
    pnfs processes for creating additional databases.
<li>Mount the pnfs filesystem.
    <pre>
    mkdir -p /pnfs/fs
    mount -o intr,hard,rw localhost:/fs   /pnfs/fs
    </pre>
    Make sure you are using the 'localhost:/fs' mountpoint
    and not the '&lt;hostName&gt;:/fs' mountpoint.
    <br>
    This entry into pnfs allows you to configure the
    export tables a.s.o. It <strong>can't</strong> be used as the 
    frontend to the HSM because it allows I/O to the
    filesystem which you certainly don't want.
    See <a href=noio.html>No Io</a> for further information
    about I/O and no I/O.
<li>From here on the system is configured and can be used
    following the description in <a href=export.html>export</a>.
    But for convenience there is a tool to modify the
    export table : <strong>pmount</strong>
    This tool assumes that the 'localhost:/fs' is mounted on
    '/pnfs/fs'. If you need to change this path
    you have to modify the 
    <strong>exports=/pnfs....</strong> line with in <strong>pmount</strong>
    as well.
<li>Prepare the regular mountpoints. (Example only)
    <pre>
    cd /pnfs/fs/admin/etc/exports
    mkdir mountpoints
    cd mountpoints
    cat >Generic
    /admin   /0/root/fs/admin   0   nooptions
    /usr     /0/root/fs/usr    30   nooptions
    ^D   
    </pre>
    /admin and /usr can now be exported.
    /usr is a HSM aware mountpoint. No I/O is allowed.
    Any number of mountpoints may be added here.
    Note that the regular clients must only mount filesystems
    exported with the <strong>30</strong> option( <a href=noio.html>NOIO</a>).
<li>Declare a host to be a regular pnfs client. EXPORT( HSM usage only,
    I/O is not allowed )
    <pre>
    root@watphrakeo:/pnfs/fs/admin/etc/exports > <strong>pmount add host /usr</strong>
     Info : Host knossos not yet in export table
     Info : Adding knossos (131.169.87.223) to export table
    </pre>
    From now on knossos may mount &lt;pnfsHostName&gt;:/usr to whatever
    it likes.
<li><strong>REMARK</strong> NFS-2 isn't something which can be
    called a secure protocol. So, to reduce the possible misuse 
    pnfs disallows remote 'root' access by default.
    This behaviour can be changed on host basis creating
    a file within the already existing 
    <strong>/pnfs/fs/admin/etc/export/trusted</strong> directory.
    The filename must be the decimal dotted representation of the
    ip number of the host you want to grant root access.
    The file must contain a 15. e.g. :
    <pre>
    cd /pnfs/fs/admin/etc/exports/trusted
    cat 15 >131.169.1.221
    </pre>
    131.169.1.221 can now become root on the pnfs filesystem.
    <strong>Usually there should be no need to do this.</strong>
</ul>

<h3>The /usr/etc/pnfsSetup File</h3>
<blockquote>
When starting pnfs, the pnfsd and the pmountd assume to find
the configuration information in <strong>/usr/etc/pnfsSetup</strong>.
A sample setupfile can be found in the root directory of the
distribution. The file contains one key value pair per line,
separated by an equals sign. The meaning of most of the
keys is discussed below.
Keys which are not mentioned in this list can be
taken from the example file and need not to be modified.
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Key</th><th>meaning</th></tr>
<tr><th>shmkey</th>
<td>
The key of the shared master shared memory area. You  may take
any, as long as no other application wants to make use of the
same key. (The default is set to '1122' ).
</td>
<tr><th>shmclients</th>
<td>
The maximum number of clients which needs access to the
shared memory area. The rule of thumb 
'number of pnfsd processes' + 1 ( for the pmountd ) +
'number of admin tools running simultaniously'.
So if <strong>pnfscopies=4</strong>, <strong>shmclients=8</strong>
should be fine.
</td>
<tr><th>shmservers</th>
<td>
Must be larger then the largest database ID. If only the
pnfs admin tools are used to add databases, this is essentially the
number of databases. To avoid unnesseccary restarts of the
pnfs system, the number should be sufficiently large to cover
the near futur plans concerning database groth.
</td>
<tr><th>pnfs</th>
<td>
Is the full path of the pnfs root directory. 
$pnfs/tools needs to contain the pnfs tools and the links to the binaries.
This path usually looks like <strong>/x...x/pnfs3.1.&lt;n&gt;</strong>
</td>
<tr><th>database</th>
<td>
Is the full path of an existing directory where pnfs
stores information about its databases. It doesn't need 
much space and only contains ascii files which point to 
the actual gdbm database.
</td>
<tr><th>trash</th>
<td>
Is the full path of a directory where pnfs provides information
about files which have been deleted from pnfs.
The connected HSMs need those information to remove the
files from the HSM database ( or from tape).
Pnfs assumes to find subdirectories within $trash where
it can copy the different file levels into. The size of the
directory highly depends on the number of remove operations
and the time interval this directory is scanned to 
synchronize the HSM. ( see <a href=remove.html>remove</a> )
</td>
<tr><th>pnfscopies</th>
<td>
Number of copies of the pnfsd deamon to be started.
<strong>shmclients</strong> must exceed this number by
at least 'two'.
</td>
<tr><th>hardlinks</th>
<td>
Can be <strong>yes</strong> or <strong>no</strong> depending on
wether pnfs should support hardlinks or not. The disadvantage of
hardlinks is that there is no defined path back to the root.
So, disabling hardlinks allows  you to get the filepath from
an object only knowing its pnfsid(=inode).
</td>
<tr><th>netmask</th>
<td>
The ip netmask of you site. ( class B = 16 , class C = 8 ).
</td>
<tr><th>levelmask</th>
<td>
A sequence of 8 <strong>0</strong> or <strong>-1</strong>
separated by ':'.
The first number has to be a <strong>0</strong>. Each number corresponds
to a pnfs file level and determines if the specified level should 
belong to the user ( uid, gid .. ) or should belong to 'root'.
The way it is configured highly depends on the HSM system  
you intend to use.
</td>
<tr><th>pmountdLog<br>dbserverLog<br>pnfsdLog</th>
<td>
Points to the full pathname of the corresponding
log files. <strong>dbserverLog</strong> should point to
<strong>/dev/null</strong> in an production environment
because it still produces large amounts of debug output
which can't be switched off. <strong>pmountdLog</strong>
contains the mounts and dismounts. <strong>pnfsdLog</strong>
should be configured with <strong>pnfsdLevel=5</strong>
to report the modifications only. See <a href=logformat.html>
logformat</a> for more information.
</td>
<tr><th>pnfsdLevel<br>pmountdLevel<br>dbserverLevel</th>
<td>
These numbers determine the output level for the three deamons.
Currently only pnfsdLevel is recognized and should be set
to <strong>5</strong> to report the modifications only.
The  smaller the number the more info you will get.
</td>
