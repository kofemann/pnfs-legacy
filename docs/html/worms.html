<h1>The Pnfs Wormholes</h1>
Pnfs Wormholes are a kind of hardlink from each directory 
inside pnfs to one directory inside pnfs which doesn't need
to be mounted. We are using this feature to influence the
behaviour of HSM applications from one central point 
(directory) independently of the actual mountpoint
the corresponding host has chosen.
Wormholes are assigned 'per database' which means that
the wormhole of directory trees of two different databases may point
to different targets. (which is very unlikely to happen).
There is a small set of things you have to prepare to 
make wormholes available.
<ul>
<li>Create the root of all config directories.
<li>Get the pnfsID of that directory entry.
<li>Create all necessary subdirectories of the root config directory you need.
    Only those directories can be accessed through the wormholes.
<li>Assign the pnfsID of the wormhole target to all your 
    databases using 'sclient'.<br>
    sclient getroot &lt;shmkey&gt; &lt;databaseID&gt; &lt;pnfsID&gt;<br>
    where  &lt;shmkey&gt; is the shared memory key of your pnfs system
    as specified in /usr/etc/pnfsSetup, &lt;databaseID&gt; is the
    database identifier ( not the name ) of the database you want to
    assign to this wormhole and &lt;pnfsID&gt; is the 
    pnfsID of the root config directory.
<li>Now you may access all subdirectories of the config root 
    via .(config)(&lt;subdir&gt;) whereever you are in pnfs.
</ul>
What you need to know
<ul>
<li>There is no need to restart any of the deamons after setting or
    resetting the root config pointer with 'sclient'.
<li>The wormhole will always point to the directory
    with the specified pnfsID. A rename won't change this
    fact because the pnfsID will stay with the directory
    whatever name it may have. 
<li>Removing the config root directory and creating a
    new one without redoing the procedure above will
    let the .(config) link point to void.
<li>The actual configuration directories below the root config
    directory are referenced by name and not by pnfsID.
<li>Whenever you create a new database you have to remember
    to get install the wormhole link. It won't be automatically 
    done by 'mdb create ...'.
</ul>
<h4>Example</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#
# create the config root
#
mkdir -p /pnfs/fs/admin/etc/configdir
#
# get the pfnsID of configdir
#
pnfsID=`cat /pnfs/fs/admin/etc/.(id)(configdir)`
#
#  create the actual configuration directories below configdir
#
mkdir /pnfs/fs/admin/etc/configdir/tools
mkdir /pnfs/fs/admin/etc/configdir/flags
#
# asign the config directory to the databases.
# lets say we have 4 databases 0...3
# and our $shmkey is 1122 
#
for c in 0 1 2 3 ; do
  $pnfs/tools/sclient getroot 1122 $c $pnfsID
done
#
# from now on 
# .(config)(tools) will point to /pnfs/fs/admin/etc/configdir/tools  and
# .(config)(flags) will point to /pnfs/fs/admin/etc/configdir/flags
#
#    ask the database for the installed wormhole link
#    ( just omit the last argument )
#
for c in 0 1 2 3 ; do
  $pnfs/tools/sclient getroot 1122 $c
done
#
#  you will learn the database id, the root id of that database and
#  wormhole link (pnfsID)
#
</pre>
