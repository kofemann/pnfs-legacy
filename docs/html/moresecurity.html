<h1>Pnfs Security Enhancements</h1>
<h3>Disabling the <em>remove</em> and <em>move</em> nfs operation</h3>
<blockquote>
Pnfs, starting with V3.1.9, allows to disable the remove 
and/or move nfs operation of the content of 
directories configured as such.
<ul>
<li>Once disabled, <em>remove,move</em> will be denied on 
    the content of the corresponding directory regardless
    of the host or uid this request has been coming from.
    Not even root on localhost can perform those operations.
<li>See <em>Inheritance of security properties</em>.
<li>Other nfs operation are not affected by this property.
<li>The disable operation can only be activated/deactivated
    on the pnfs server itself as the root user.
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Disabling all nfs directory operations on nontrusted client hosts</h3>
<blockquote>
Pnfs, starting with V3.1.9, allows to disable all nfs operations
on directories (except lookup) from nontrusted hosts.
<ul>
<li>Once enabled, create,move and remove operations will be 
    allowed only by nfs client hosts assigned a trust level
    above 13.
<li>See <em>Inheritance of security properties</em>.
<li>Nfs operation on files (setattr,..) are not affected by this property.
<li>The descibed operation can only be activated/deactivated
    on the pnfs server itself as the root user.
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Inheritance of security properties</h3>
<blockquote>
Security properties might be inherited by subdirectories of 
datasets if the compile time flags MD_FLAGS_INHERIT is set.
Inheriting security properties might become rather confusing because
<blockquote><strong>
    The newly create object inherits the properties of its
    parent directory in the moment the object is created.
    Subsequent changes of the properties of the parent 
    directory don't affect the properties of the child object.
</strong>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3>Command Reference</h3>
<blockquote>
The <em>sclient</em> pnfs tool is used to set/unset the properties 
decribed above. <em>sclient</em> can only be issued on the pnfs server
itself as root user. The pnfsid is used to descibe the object
to be modified, therefore pnfs doesn't need to be mounted.
For convenience we provide a script (<em>pflags</em>) which first
maps a full pathname into a pnfsId which is then passed to <em>sclient</em>.
This script needs the pnfs filesystem to do the mapping.
